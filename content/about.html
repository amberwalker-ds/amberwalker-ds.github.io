<p>
    When I first started my journey to becoming a Data Scientist, I was pretty intimidated by all the theory, math, terminology, and coding. 
    With no prior experience in data and a background in business and management, I felt like I had a ton to catch up on. In grad school, 
    where I earned my Master’s in Data Science, I wasn’t just learning to code; 
    I was also solving complicated math problems (for the first time ever) and diving 
    into the methodology of how Data Science actually works—not just what the code does (I was really doubting my life choices at this point).
</p>
    But I was determined to keep up with my peers (who all had a strong math background), 
    I pushed myself to really understand the theory and math behind it all, even when it felt super overwhelming. 
    Looking back, I wish there had been more resources that broke down these complex ideas into something easier to digest—I was always 
    simplifying things myself, turning the really abstract concepts into something practical, which in turn helped me to grasp these concepts and 
    eventually master Data Science and the theory.
<p>
    Now, I want to help others who might be in the same boat, or even experienced data scientists and engineers who need to learn a new 
    theory or topic (the field is constantly changing), keeping up with the change is critical. My goal is to make these tough topics easier to 
    understand, giving you a strong foundation before you dive deeper. 
 </p>   
    Let’s be real—research papers can be dense, technical, and just hard to get through. That’s where this blog comes in. I’m here to break down 
    complex studies and concepts into simple, actionable insights, so you can feel confident diving into a new DS topic, without getting tangled 
    up in all the jargon. I also like to throw in my own personal opinion on these topics, which might provide you with 
    a different and fresh perspective on things.
 <p>   
    I'm always open to feedback and suggestions on how to improve, so please don't be afraid to reach out and tell me things you feel could be 
    different! I'm also on TikTok sharing research, if you enjoy a more visual way of learning. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@biohackfact?_t=8rCYHvrGRv0&_r=1" target="_blank" aria-label="TikTok">
